Hybrid system- Monte Carlo Simulation with Machine Learning

Supply chain management (SCM) deals with the planning and control of materials and information flow in the distribution channel. Efficient SCM calls for data-driven decisions to optimize operations and achieve cost-effectiveness (Gunasekaran et al., 2017). Our study aims to predict late delivery risks using machine learning (ML) techniques.
